# Hello everyone ‚úãüèΩ

### I am √çtalo Maio, from Brazil.

With **14 years of programming experience**, I'm a **Senior Frontend Specialist** focused on delivering solutions that transform ideas into highly effective and performant user interfaces. My expertise is rooted in **JavaScript and TypeScript**, with **6 years of consolidated experience in React and React Native**, and a strong command of **Next.js** for developing modern, optimized web applications.

I've worked on **projects of all sizes**, from startups to multinational corporations, and I have experience in **technical leadership**, guiding teams to achieve excellent deliveries. My passion for **UI/UX** is complemented by a relentless pursuit of **performance**, ensuring applications don't just function, but exceed expectations. I adhere to **modular and molecular architectures**, applying **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles for clean, scalable, and maintainable code, built on **atomic components**. Recognizing the importance of **accessibility**, I strive to implement it in my solutions.

I've recently expanded my focus into **Generative Artificial Intelligence (GEN AI)**, actively creating **multi-agent systems** using **LangChain and LangGraph** with **TypeScript, NestJS**, and **Next.js**. This blend allows me to develop innovative solutions that seamlessly combine AI with user experience, adding strategic value.
